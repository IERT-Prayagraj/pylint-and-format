Perform Style Checking on your Python 3 using flake8 and formate code using black


<b>Flake8</b> is a Python library that wraps PyFlakes, pycodestyle and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script. It is a great 
toolkit for checking your codebase against coding style (PEP8), programming errors (like “library imported but unused” and “Undefined name”) and checking cyclomatic complexity.

<b>Black</b> is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.
